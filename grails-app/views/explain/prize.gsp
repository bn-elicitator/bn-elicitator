	<h1>Prizes</h1>

	<h3>
		After the final round of this survey is complete, a prize of $100 will be awarded to one participant who
		completed the survey.
	</h3>

	<p>
		The winner will be drawn randomly from all participants who completed every round of
		the survey. Participants who withdrew before the end of the survey will not be eligible.
	</p>

	<p>
		The winner will be contacted via the email address used to signup (or the email used to register their
		Facebook account â€“ if they signed up for the survey using Facebook). If we are unable to contact the winner
		via this email after 1 month, they will forfeit the prize and a new winner will be drawn.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your contact email is <strong>${user.email}</strong>. If you would like to change it, please contact
		<a href="mailto:${adminEmail}">${adminEmail}</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		To ensure transparency, the winners name will be displayed at this website after they have been awarded their
		prize. To be eligible for the prize, you will need to consent to your name being displayed if you are drawn
		as the winner.
