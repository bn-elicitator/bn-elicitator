NeticaJ

If you want to be able to export BN's from the web-app (as an administrator), and why wouldn't you? Then you'll need to have access to NeticaJ. This requires a license, and as such, I plan on removing the depenency on this if anybody wishes to make use of the software. But because we had a site license floating around here at Monash, I found it easier to just use that to begin with.
