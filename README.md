bn-elicitator
=============

Bayesian Network elicitator, using a methodology more akin to a survey then traditional interviews.

This is a project I'm working on for my PhD thesis. Traditionally, in order to construct a Bayesian Network, you would sit down with a group of experts and discuss in a workshop-like manner. This software is a survey-like system, where people simply answer questions like a typical survey, with a few twists. Once they have completed the survey, we can use that information to construct a BN.

In addition to the survey-like methodology, it also makes use of the Delphi method, where people answer the survey in rounds. 
After the first round, they are presented (anonymously) with the responses from each other participant, along with how confident they were and their comments about the decisions they made. 
It is hoped that this allows the people to converge towards a consensus agreement, without having to go through the workshop-like process.
