Explain WHY we collect confidence

Add ticks to confidence slider.

Prompt if they click next without finding any variables which are useful.

Replace "influences" with -> (and add a tooltip)

Change the "Has influence on" and "Is influenced by" in the main list

Make "once you've finished survey..." message to only show on confirmation of clicking the "Finish" button. Be careful using terminology "round".
Change to something like:

"Thanks for completing the survey, we'll email you when the next round starts. 

In the meantime, you can still make changes."

Write about Self selection of participants, and how they are netizens
